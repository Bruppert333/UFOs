## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to make a website that can use multiple filters at the same time to sort the table by Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. This was done by creating a function to loop through the data and only keep the results that match the search criteria.

## Results
To use the new web page is actually very simple. You can simply type in what you are searching for in the filters, then the table will display that information as long as it is in the Data.
## Summary
A drawback to this design is for example; if you were to look for a state city and date and one of those filters do not match the data. It automatically will not bring in the information. So lets say you wanted benton, AR on 1/2/2010. It would automatically not show you anything because there is not data for that specific date.
